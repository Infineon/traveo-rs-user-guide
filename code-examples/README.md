## 1. [gpio-access-t2g-bodyentry-starterkit](https://github.com/Infineon/gpio-access-t2g-bodyentry-starterkit)
This code example demonstrates how to use the [CYT2B7 PAC](https://crates.io/crates/cyt2b7) to control read/write GPIOs using the on-board switch (SW1) and LEDs (LED1, LED4). In addition, it also demonstrates safe and unsafe Rust to access peripheral via the PAC.
